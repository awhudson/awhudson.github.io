I am a fifth year PhD studnet in the University of Washington Department of Biostatistics, and I am advised by [Ali Shojaie](http://faculty.washington.edu/ashojaie/).  My research primarily focuses on high-dimensional and nonparametric statistical inference, with applications in public health and medicine. Currently, I am developing methdods for honest uncertainty quantification for estimation of infinite-dimensional (or function-valued) statistical parameters in nonparametric and semiparametric models. I also work on problems related to effect modification and analysis of high-dimensional biological networks.
